Currently there're a lot of WAF and a lot of papers and articles about how to good or bad are each available options, but there's not a standard way to test each WAF following these requisites:

The test must be:

- Must be repeatable
- Must measure a do all the test to each product that want to test
- Must be automatic
- Must be measurable the results
- Must know what


Supported attacks
